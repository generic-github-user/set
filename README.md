# set

*Semantic Edit Tracker*

set aims to address some of my (relatively finicky) gripes with
[Git](https://git-scm.com/). As its name hints at, the objective is a versional
control system (VCS) that understands the structure of the content you are
editing and (by extension) the nature of any edits you make. In practice, this
should mean fewer annoying merge conflicts and a more intuitive toolkit for
version tracking.
